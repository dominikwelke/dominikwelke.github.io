Vice News has visited us at the German Film Museum and produced a short video about our `Cinema Project <https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/former-departments/department-of-neuroscience/aesthetic-experience/brain-on-screen.html>`_.
A very professional Crew - no nonsense shots and almost zero interference with the research workflow :)

The short was `published on their Twitter <https://twitter.com/vicenews/status/1127211761654878208>`_.
