My new tutorial on how to work with frequency-tagged data in MNE-Python has just been merged!
Check it out `here <https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/time-freq/50_ssvep.html>`_!

This is a small spin-off from my current methods-paper on the effect of experimental conditions in EEG studies.
Here we used an auditory (ASSR) stimulus as a proxy measure for EEG recording quality.
Stay tuned for the preprint.

Thanks to `Evgenii Kalenkovich <https://github.com/kalenkovich>`_ for working together on the tutorial :)
