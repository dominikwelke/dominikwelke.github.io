I am a biologist studying individual behavior and physiology in the most ubiquitous primate species on earth - *Homo sapiens*.
As a PhD student in the `VisNA Lab <https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/forschung/projektteams/visna-lab.html>`_ at Max-Planck-Institute for Empirical Aesthetics I worked on the interactions of visual aesthetic preferences with other high-level cognitive processes such as reward processing, engagement, or creativity and insight. 
In previous positions I have worked on more applied topics such as brain-computer interfaces (decoding observed errors from the EEG, during my Masters) or biomimetics (morphology of functional plant surfaces, way back during my Bachelors).
I recently joined the `EEGManyLabs <https://osf.io/yb3pq/wiki/home/>`_ core team to work on one of the largest corpora of EEG data to date and advancing Open Science.

I mainly collect behavioral data together with EEG and eye tracking, sometimes along with peripheral physiology (ECG, EMG etc).  
Yet, I fancy research tech and also have some experience with intracranial EEG, DBS, fNIRS, fMRI, motion capturing, facial emotion tracking etc. as well as slice physiology, patch-clamp, (opto)genetics, electron/fluorescence/light microscopy etc. in the more hardcore biology realms.
I am also interested in meta-science and friend of the open science movement. 
I integrated best practice thinking, power analysis, preregistrations, replication efforts and preprints into my research workflow.
I contribute to FOSS code bases such as the MNE-Python ecosystem.
