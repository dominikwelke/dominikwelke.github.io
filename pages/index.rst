I am a biologist studying individual behavior and physiology of one of the most ubiquitous species in the world - *Homo sapiens*.
As a PhD student in the `VisNA Lab <https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/forschung/projektteams/visna-lab.html>`_ at Max-Planck-Institute for Empirical Aesthetics I work on the interactions of visual aesthetic preferences with other high-level cognitive functions such as general reward processing, engagement, or creativity and insight. 
In previous positions I had worked on more applied topics such as brain-computer interfaces (decoding observed errors from the EEG, during my Masters) or biomimetics (morphology of functional plant surfaces, way back during my Bachelors).

I usually collect behavioral data together with non-invasive EEG and eye tracking, often along with peripheral physiology measures (ECG, EMG etc).  
Yet, I fancy research technology and methodology in general and also gained some experience with intracranial EEG, DBS, fNIRS, fMRI, motion capturing, facial emotion tracking etc. as well as slice physiology, patch-clamp, genetics, electron/fluorescence/light microscopy etc. in the more hardcore biology realms.

I am interested in meta-science and fellow of the open science movement.
This means I integrated best practice thinking, power analysis, preregistrations, replication approaches and preprints into my research workflow.
I follow the discussion in the community and regularly contribute to FOSS code bases such as the MNE-Python ecosystem.
